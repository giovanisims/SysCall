# 🐍💻 SysCall - Full-Stack Web Application

**SysCall** is a full-stack web application designed to be used as a middle man between users who need tech support and technicians looking for customers, with support for either B2B or B2C implementations, built with a **Python (FastAPI)** backend and a classic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** front-end. It demonstrates a complete client-server architecture, using **Jinja2** for templating and a **MariaDB** database for persistence.

This project was developed as a final assignment for the **Experiência Criativa** course 🎓. It showcases how modern web technologies come together to create a functional application with both a user-facing interface and server-side logic. 🚀

### 🚀 Technologies Used

* **🌐 Front-End** — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and interactivity.

* **🐍 Back-End** — **FastAPI** for the high-performance server-side logic and API.

* **📄 Templating** — **Jinja2** for dynamically rendering server-side data into HTML pages.

* **🗃️ Database** — **MariaDB** for persistent data storage.

* **📦 Dependencies** — Managed with **npm** (`package-lock.json`) and **pip** (`requirements.txt`).

### ✨ Features

* ✅ **Full-Stack Architecture**: Clear separation between the front-end (`pages` folder) and the Python back-end.

* ✅ **FastAPI-Powered Backend**: The core application logic is handled by `main.py` using the modern FastAPI framework.

* ✅ **Dynamic Front-End**: An interactive user interface that communicates with the backend, with pages rendered by Jinja2.

* ✅ **MariaDB Integration**: Includes a `Database` directory, showing a robust and scalable database setup.

* ✅ **Organized Structure**: A well-defined project structure for a college-level web application.
